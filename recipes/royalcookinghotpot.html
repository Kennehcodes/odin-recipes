                    <li>Take the radish, onions, leeks and cut them up and way you'd like and boil them with five cups of water. </li>
                    <li>Tear the enoki mushrooms, oyster mushrooms into bit sized portions for the hotpot.</li>
                    <li>Chop the King Oyster mushroom, shiitake, cabbage, carrot, minari and onion into pieces around 5-6cm in length.</li>
                    <li>Cut the tofu to a 1cm thickness.</li>
                    <li>When the broth finishes prepare the dipping sauce. Just combine all the ingredients together and put into small bowls to dip the vegetables and tofu in.</li>
                    <li>When the broth is fragant and ready after 30 minutes to 3 hours of boiling/simmerring, you can add the ingredients for the hotpot, boil them and eat them from the pot. Feel free to dip the vegetables in the dipping sauce that you made.</li>
