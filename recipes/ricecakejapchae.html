        <a>I made this dish at CJ The Kitchen in Seoul as a part of a vegetarian cooking class in 2018. This dish was pretty special to make and I learned that the term Japchae refers to anything cut long and thin and mixed. This is a different kind of japchae than you might be expecting but it is very delicious so give it a try!</a>
